# README - FINAL SUBMISSION #
#############################

Requirements and instructions for sub-challenges 1 and 2 are given in the "code" folder, in SC1_pipeline.sh and SC2_pipeline.sh, respectively.

Both scripts can be executed to run the whole pipeline, but we recommend running one step at a time, (so that the output makes more sense).
